Welcome to the first part of my Electrical Engineering Blogs. These blogs are where I will post everything I learn during my time as an electrical engineering student.
I am doing this for my own reference later on and for others to read as well. I learn best by reciting information and teaching others so I think by doing this I will
help myself retain knowledge better as well. 

## Voltage

In the world of electricity you will here the word voltage. It is also called EMF for electromotive force. My understanding of voltage is that it is an electrical potential. 
You may think of voltage as a pressure of electrons. Given two wires hanging out of a wall, if one of them has a higher pressure of electrons, then there is a voltage difference
across the wires. The electrons from the wire with the higher potential or pressure want to go to an area of lower potential.
