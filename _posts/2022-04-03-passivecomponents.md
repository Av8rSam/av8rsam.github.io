Welcome to part two of the basic electrical engineering series. This post will cover everything resisitors. Please read the previous post about voltage, current, and resistance if you don't understand those concepts yet. 

Resistors come in several different forms. The most common look like:

Their resistance is measured in Ohms. Resisitors are used to provide a known load to a circuit. Combining resisitors, we can make things such as voltage dividers or current dividers. These can be used to provide a specific voltage to an IC. Lets analyze some circuits, starting with circuit A:
