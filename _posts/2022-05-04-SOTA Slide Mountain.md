**First SOTA**

On May 1st Nolan and I hiked to the top of Slide Mountain in the Catskills. I only got one contact so not enough for the points but it was fun setting up the rig in the field. My gear consisted of the Yaesu FT-891, a 20m dipole, RigExpert antenna analyzer, and a Bioenno Power 12AH battery. Here's my radio with the nice aluminum side rails from Etsy.

And here's Nolan operating my radio on CW. As he said "100 watts coming at you fast!"

You can see all my gear except the antenna in this picture. The battery is wrapped in foam to protect it and I have a scarf over the radio because the sun was making it really hot. Nolan was able to get 5 contacts on CW with my radio which was pretty cool. As for me, 20m SSB was plugged with the Florida QSO party and I had a hard time finding anyone else. My only contact was:

KB1YTO

Anyways, it was a fun trip. Here are some more photos from the trip:
