The thevenin equivalent circuit is a circuit with just a voltage source and a resistor. The resistor is symbolic of a circuit's internal impedance. If the impedance of a power source is known, then the load impedance can be tuned to match for better power transfer. An example of this is when installing speakers and amplifiers. The amplifier might be a 2 or 4 ohm unit which means you need to purchase a speaker rated for 2 or 4 ohms. If your computer is rated for 165 ohms then you should get 165 ohm headphones. 

**Thevenin Equivalent Steps**

1. Remove the load and then find the open circuit voltage at the load terminals. This is Vt
2. Remove the load, turn off sources, and find the resistance across the load terminals. This is Rt

**Thevenin Equivalent Example**

In this circuit the nodes labelled A and B are the terminals where a load would connect to, maybe a speaker for example. 
To find the voltage across A and B, we will use the voltage divider equation. Ressitor R3 doesn't have any current going through it so it is basically just a wire. This means the voltage at the junction between R1, R2, and R3 is equal to the voltage at point A. So, the voltage across A and B is equal to 
![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}V_{AB}=V_1*\frac{R_2}{R_1&plus;R_2&plus;R_4})
That will be the thevenin voltage. 
Next, to find the thevenin ressitance, we need to turn off the voltage source. When a voltage source is turned off, the equivalent is just a wire. That is easy to understand since a wire with theoretically zero resistance cannot have a voltage across it so that means zero volts. For a current source, when turned off, would be equivalent to an open circuit. 
For our example, the open circuit resistance would be:
![equation2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}R_{AB}=(R_1&plus;R_4)||(R_2)&plus;(R_3))
The vertical double bars signifies that the resistors are in parallel. 
Together, the final thevenin equivalent circuit looks like:

**Power**

I think before I talk about max power, I should talk about power. Power is voltage multiplied by current. It is measured in watts and is a true indicator of what work can be done with electricity. For example, radio transmitter output is measured in watts. Microwave ovens are measured in watts.  In a lot of foreign countries, instead of horsepower, a cars power output is measured in KiloWatts. 

**Max Power**

If we want to supply the most power to a load connected to a thevenin power source, we need to make the load's impedance the same as the source's impedance. Thinking about it, since the load is in series with the source, if the load's resistance is too high, the voltage will be higher but the current will be lower. If the resistance is too low, the current will be higher but the voltage will be low. The highest power is when they are equal. 

The current going through the circuit will be equal to: 
![equation3](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}I=\frac{V_{TH}}{R_{TH}&plus;R_L})
and the voltage across the load resistance will be equal to: 
![equation4](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}V_L=V_{TH}*\frac{R_L}{R_{TH}&plus;R_L})
And if we multiply these two together we will get the equation:
![equation5](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}P_{TH}=\frac{V_{TH}^{2}*R_L}{(R_{TH}&plus;R_L)^{2}})
If you were to graph this equation on a computer graphing calculator with RL being the independent variable, you would find that the peak in the curve occurs when RL is equal to RTH. Also, remember that all values must be greater than zero.
