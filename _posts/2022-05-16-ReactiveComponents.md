**Capacitors**

Capacitors are a component of electronics used to store electrical energy in the form of electric fields. They consist of two conductive plates separated by a non-conducting insulator. They store electrical energy by gathering charges on the conducting plates. For this reason, once they are full, capacitors behave like an open circuit because no more current can flow.

Capacitors have the main equation: 
![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}C=\frac{Q}{V})
Where C is capacitance in Farads, Q is charge in coulombs, and V is volts. The larger the capacitance, the larger the amount of charge a capacitor can store. Typically you will read the capacitance and voltage rating on a capacitor. The voltage rating is how many volts you can apply to the capacitor before it breaks down.
