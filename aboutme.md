My name is Sam Della-Santina. I am currently attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. I am studying electrical engineering here and I am super enthusiastic about every thing electronics. I also fly racing drones, fly RC planes, and am obviously into aviation. Anything that can combine my passion for electronics and aviation is right up my alley. My dreams in life are to know everything there is about electronics and get my pilots license. I am not 100% sure what I want to do in the Army yet but I have some more time to decide.
